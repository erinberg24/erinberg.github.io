                    In this paper, we discuss and analyze how accurately we can predict whether a patient has breast cancer based on attributes that any woman can obtain from a routine checkup. Our aim was to identify the optimal conditions for several classification tasks and enhance the one that produced the best results. Classification tasks that were implemented included Artificial Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, and Logistic Regression.</p>
